%\subsection*{\textsc{\underline{Objective}}}
%
%\hspace{13mm} A summer internship position in applications or
%algorithmic analysis/development in the areas of reinforcement
%learning, machine learning, pattern recognition, planning, or
%related fields.

\subsection*{\textsc{\underline{Research Interests}}}


My core research interest is in \textbf{machine learning for interactive systems that maximizes a utility function by taking
actions}, which is in contrast to prediction-oriented machine learning like supervised learning. My area of focus is
\textbf{reinforcement learning}, including \textbf{contextual bandits}, and I am also interested in related areas such as large-scale learning, active learning, and planning. In the past, I have applied my work to recommendation,
Web search, advertising, conversation systems, and spam detection.

%
%My PhD research focuses on \textbf{mathematical analysis of
%sequential decision making algorithms}.  I am financially
%supported by funding from the \textbf{National Science Foundation
%(NSF)}, supervised by \textbf{Prof. Michael Littman} at the
%\textbf{Rutgers University}. My representative scientific
%contributions include:
%%
%\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.1in}
%%
%\item{Proposed an algorithm for solving sequential decision making
%problems with continuous variables; it enjoys strong theoretical
%guarantees and is computationally more efficient than standard
%approaches (published in AAAI'2005).}
%%
%\item{Developed a general framework for state abstraction in
%Markov decision processes that unifies almost all previously
%proposed notion of state abstraction (published in
%AI\&Math'2006).}
%%
%\item{Proposed the state-of-the-art algorithm and proved it
%converges to near-optimal solutions in polynomially many steps
%(published in ICML'2006).}
%%
%\item{Proposed two provably efficient model-based algorithms that
%enjoy better running-time efficiency than previous algorithms
%(published in UAI'2006).}
%%
%\item{Analyzed and proved that a family of popular algorithms used
%for constructing features in sequential decision making is sound
%as they consistently lead to error reduction (published in
%ICML'2007).}
%%
%\item{Used linear algebra and matrix theory to compare two popular
%algorithms in sequential decision making, which leads to useful
%insights of their relative strengths (published in ICML'2008).}
%%
%\item{Proved a fundamental equivalence of two important classes of
%algorithms, which gives important insights into many existing
%feature-selection algorithms (published in ICML'2008).}
%%
%\item{Proposed a new mathematical framework called KWIK that
%covers and unifies a number of existing provably efficient
%algorithms (published in ICML'2008).}
%%
%\item{Developed and experimented with a highly efficient algorithm
%for solving large-scale machine-learning problem (to appear in
%NIPS'2008).}
%%
%\item{Proved that a classic algorithm, proposed $15$ years ago,
%can indeed converge to the optimal solution when it is run forever
%(under review, 2008).}
