<h2>Interests</h2>

My core research interest is in <b>machine learning for interactive systems that maximizes a utility function 
by taking actions</b>, which is in contrast to <i>prediction</i>-oriented machine learning like supervised learning.
My area of focus is <b>reinforcement learning</b>, including the important subclass known as <b>contextual bandits</b>;
I am also interested in related areas such as large-scale online learning with big data, active learning, and planning.
In the past, I have applied my work to recommendation, Web search, advertising, and conversational systems.

<p>
Most of my work can be grouped into several clusters:
<ul>
<li><a href="projects/exploration.html">Exploration (<b>data collection</b> in RL)</a>
<li><a href="projects/vfa.html">Value function and policy learning (<b>training</b> in RL)</a>
<li><a href="projects/off-policy.html">Off-policy learning (<b>evaluation</b> in RL)</a>
<li><a href="projects/app-web.html">Applications to the Web</a>
<li><a href="projects/app-nlp.html">Applications to NLP</a>
</ul>
